# formTest-Final

E2E acceptance testing with Ruby-Watir and Rspec

The code and folder structure was created with the help of bundler gem. 
I have made edits and changes to the gemfile and coded the tests. ./Gemfile contains the gems and their descriptions. 
Spec folder includes the rspec test files. Watir gem was used for the automation library. 
Rspec was used for BDD framework. Ruby was used as programming language. 
Faker gem was used for generating test data. 
Rspec format html and profiling were used to produce test reports.

To run the tests: 

After cloning the repo, 

Run 'bundle install' and 'bundle update'

Run 'bundle exec spec' or 'rspec' under spec folder

The test logs and reports will be generated in rspec_results.html

For the tests to work : download issues.pdf and place it under 'C:\upload\Issues.pdf'
